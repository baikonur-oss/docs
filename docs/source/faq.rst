FAQ

Why is this project named "Baikonur"?
-------------------------------------

Baikonur project name comes from `Baikonur Cosmodrome <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikonur_Cosmodrome>`_,
a spaceport located in Kazakhstan known for launching the first artificial satellite and the first human spaceflight.
Hence, project logo is a space rocket.

The reason why we chose a space theme in the first place is quite simple - we followed
`Ansible Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com/>`_ and `GitHub Universe <https://githubuniverse.com/>`_.


Is this project limited to Terraform Modules?
---------------------------------------------

Absolutely not. Although Baikonur Project started as a platform for open sourcing internally used Terraform Modules,
we have been creating Python libraries, CLI tools, and we are preparing to publish our infrastructure Knowledge Base.


Do I have to be a CyberAgent employee to become a contributor/maintainer/core member?

You do not *have to*. :)
